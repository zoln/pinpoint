**Pinpoint** is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java. Modelled after [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html "Google Dapper"), Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.

* Install agents without changing a single line of code
* Minimal impact on performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)

## Latest Release (2016/12/08)
We're happy to announce the release of Pinpoint v1.6.0.
Please check the release note at (https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/releases/tag/1.6.0)
We're now focusing on developing v1.6.1.

Special shout out to dawidmalina, jiaqifeng, suraj-raturi, barneykim, fanyeren, abhijith0505, guindous, 999fg, mvlbarcelos and many others for your contribution and feedback.
Without your help, we would not have been able to reach our current level of product maturity. We are extremely grateful for all your help and will continue to try our very best to provide you with the best possible experience using Pinpoint.
We look forward to working with you as we enter the next chapter in development.
Thank you.

The current stable version is [**v1.6.0**](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/releases/tag/1.6.0).

### Plugin Development Guide (2016/03/18)
We now have a [plugin development guide](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/wiki/Pinpoint-Plugin-Developer-Guide "Pinpoint Plugin Development Guide"). Yay!

## Overview
Services nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a blackbox. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.<br/>
For a more intimate guide, please check out our *[Introduction to Pinpoint](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/wiki#video-clips)* video clip.

* **ServerMap** - Understand the topology of any distributed systems by visualizing how their components are interconnected. Clicking on a node reveals details about the component, such as its current status, and transaction count.
* **Realtime Active Thread Chart** - Monitor active threads inside applications in real-time.
* **Request/Response Scatter Chart** - Visualize request count and response patterns over time to identify potential problems. Transactions can be selected for additional detail by **dragging over the chart**.

* **CallStack** - Gain code-level visibility to every transaction in a distributed environment, identifying bottlenecks and points of failure in a single view.

  ![Call Stack](doc/img/ss_call-stack.png)

* **Inspector** - View additional details on the application such as CPU usage, Memory/Garbage Collection, TPS, and JVM arguments.

## Third Party Agents/Plugins
There may be agents, and plugins that are being developed and managed by other individuals/organizations. Please take a look [here](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/wiki#third-party-agentsplugins) for the list and see if you would like to help out in their development.

## Quick Start
You may run a sample Pinpoint instance in your own machine by running four simple scripts for each components: Collector, Web, Sample TestApp, HBase.

Once the components are running, you should be able to visit http://localhost:28080 to view the Pinpoint Web UI, and http://localhost:28081 to generate transactions on the Sample TestApp.

For details, please refer to the [quick-start guide](quickstart/README.md).

**Please follow our [guideline](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint/wiki/Pinpoint-Plugin-Developer-Guide#iii-plugin-contribution-guideline "Plugin PR Guideline") when making pull-requests for new plugins.**

For all pull-requests, make sure you've read through [CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) and note that you will have to complete a  [CLA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oDX26pwmVZSoDfL9MwvwLsM23dHqc5pvgoZCp7jM940/viewform?c=0&w=1 "Contributor License Agreement") for your first pull-request.

We would love to see additional tracing support for libraries such as [Storm](https://storm.apache.org "Apache Storm"), [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org "Apache HBase"), as well as profiler support for additional languages (.NET, C++).

## Google Analytics
The web module has google analytics attached that tracks the number and the order of button clicks in the server map, transaction list, and the inspector view.

This data is used to better understand how users interact with the Web UI which gives us valuable information in improving Pinpoint Web's user experience.
To disable this for any reason, set the following option to false in *pinpoint-web.properties* for your web instance.
```
config.sendUsage=false
```
